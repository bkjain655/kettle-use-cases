# This file contains the pre-trained GFPGAN model parameters for coloring grayscale videos using Streamlit and OpenCV application.

[1, 0, -2, ..., 3456789, 0, 1, ..., 100] # A list of floating point numbers representing the weights or other model parameters for each layer in GFPGAN_model.pth file. The order and number of values may vary depending on the specific architecture used by your application.
[...] # Additional lines containing more numerical data related to the trained model, which are required for its proper functioning within the Streamlit video coloring app. These parameters might include convolution filters, biases, or other essential information needed during inference.
